#Mac Prep
##Download
First:

xcode 7 from apple: https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/ 

xCode takes a while to download, it can take up to 20 minutes - so don't freak out when it isn't functional in 3 minutes.


Then: 

git: https://git-scm.com/download/mac 

Sometimes, Apple will not allow you to double-click and start the installation process. In this case, right click the package and click open.

 

After you install xcode and git, check the version of git in the terminal. Copy and paste the text below into the terminal:

    git --version

If you have never used the terminal, that's okay! Go to the search icon at the top right hand part of your screen, click it and type in the word terminal.
